  <p>Hey there! My name is Chris Rice, and I'm an amateur coder just starting
     out. In order to practice some of the concepts I've learned, I've built a
     blog on one of my other greatest passions: <strong> food </strong>. Feel
     free to browse around and try some of my favorite recipes!    <br /> <br />

  	Stay crispy, <br /> <br />
    Chris
